# EEG Monitoring: Harmful Brain Activity Classification

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a valuable tool for monitoring brain activity, but the manual analysis of EEG data is time-consuming and prone to human error. The goal of this project is to develop an automated EEG classification system that can accurately identify patterns of brain activity, including seizures and other harmful conditions. By leveraging signal processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, we aim to streamline EEG analysis and provide clinicians with timely and reliable diagnostic information.
