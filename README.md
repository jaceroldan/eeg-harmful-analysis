# EEG Monitoring: Harmful Brain Activity Classification

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a valuable tool for monitoring brain activity, but the manual analysis of EEG data is time-consuming and prone to human error. The goal of this project is to develop an automated EEG classification system that can accurately identify patterns of brain activity, including seizures and other harmful conditions. By leveraging signal processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, we aim to streamline EEG analysis and provide clinicians with timely and reliable diagnostic information.

## Objectives
* Develop preprocessing pipelines to clean and preprocess EEG data, including artifact removal, filtering, and feature extraction.
* Explore signal processing techniques to extract informative features from EEG signals, focusing on frequency bands and time-frequency domain representations.
* Train a support vector machine (SVM) and a K-means clustering (KNN) model to understand the underlying patterns in the dataset and create a 
* Optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and model ensemble techniques.
* Evaluate the trained models using appropriate metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Develop a scalable and efficient workflow for processing large EEG datasets, leveraging parallelization and optimization techniques.
